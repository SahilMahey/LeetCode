Problem is that you have to find elements which are common in both arrays. both arays are always placed in non-decreasing order.

Sample Input 1 :
2
6 4
1 2 2 2 3 4
2 2 3 3
3 2
1 2 3
3 4  
Sample Output 1 :
2 2 3
3   
Explanation for Sample Input 1 :
For the first test case, the common elements are 2 2 3 in both the arrays, so we print it.

For the second test case, only 3 is common so we print 3.
Sample Input 2 :
2
3 3 
1 4 5
3 4 5
1 1
3
6
Sample Output 2 :
